## Beam-python IO connector for [Cloud Redis](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/tree/main/packages/google-cloud-redis)


This Python package is a Apache Beam IO [connector](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/connectors/) that simplifies integrating Google [Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/) for Redis with your Beam pipelines. It acts as a bridge, allowing you to seamlessly read and write data to and from your Redis instance. The full SDK documentation is available [here](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/redis/latest).
